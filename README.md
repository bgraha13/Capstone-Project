# Emissions Tracker Tool
### A handy tracker of emissions trends by country. This application also compares future emissions projections with the UNEP emissions goals to reduce global warming to 1.5&deg;C by 2100. 
  Emission of greenhouse gasses such as CO<sub>2</sub> by human activities is one of the leading causes of global warming and climate change. Following the industrial revolution, combined land and ocean temperature increased at an average of 0.08&deg;C per decade. Further, average temperature trends have more than doubled to 0.18&deg;C per decade since 1981. These trends have corresponded to an overall 2&deg;C increase in global temperature since the pre-industrial era.  
  
  The process of climate change has been proposed to cause such environmental phenomena as rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and extreme weather events. These phenomena are expected to degrade Earth’s biodiversity as regions become uninhabitable for both human and nonhuman life. As a result, it is necessary to develop international policies that limit global emissions, thereby slowing the process of climate change to a sustainable rate.   
  
  In this project, we analyze emissions data for an array of the world’s leading CO<sub>2</sub> emitters and provide emissions predictions for a desired input year. This tracker tool allows the user to select a desired country, CO<sub>2</sub> emission metric, and projected year and displays a map and projection of emissions trends for the selected year and metric. Emissions have been reported to be growing exponentially in recent decades, so time series data were presented on a logrithmic scale and fitted to a linear model for projected emissions predictions.
