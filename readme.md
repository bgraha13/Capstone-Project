Project description: 

Our project focuses on tracking the greenhouse gases emission with respect to time of 60 countries worldwide. The carbon dioxide, known as the greenhouse gas, is very closely related to public health, especially to heat-related morbidity and mortality. The objective of our project is to develop a global environmental tracker tool. Our shiny app consists of three pages. On the first page, we offered a colorful scatterplot for displaying the metric users select of all the countries. This gives the user an overview of the environmental trend globally. 
Our second page provides an interactive global map paired with metric analysis of a specific country.
Our third page, which is CO2 emission specific, displays CO2 emission with respect to time and offer predictions of the future CO2 emission. We assumed the environmental data changes exponentially with respect to time and we implemented exponential fit to the available data for making the predictions. The users are able to select environmental features, countries and input a year they want to predict when using our app.
